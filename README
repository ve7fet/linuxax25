This is NOT the official Linux AX.25 software suite (libax25, ax25-apps, and ax25-tools). 
The official home is hosted by the Linux Ham group at http://www.linux-ax25.org/wiki/Main_Page That is where official development should take place.

However Lee Woldanski <ve7fet@tparc.org> performed a remarkable job reorganizing AX.25 suite in order to facilitate packaging on many distro. Lee also fixed a number of bugs.

***Building from Source***
See the "Releases" link on this page to download the current source tarballs.


***Debian Package Building***
You should be able to build a Debian package (.deb) for any of libax25 (will also build a -dev package with header files), ax25tools, or ax25apps.
 
You will need the necessary Debian package building tools installed.

From inside the chosen folder, run "debuild -us -uc" to build an un-signed package.

Other useful commands are:
fakeroot debian/rules clean
fakeroot debian/rules build

Note that the libax25 package conflicts with some files found in libc6-dev. The offending
files are:
        netax25/ax25.h
        netrose/rose.h
        netrom/netrom.h

Those files belong to libax25, and as such, this package is marked to replace
them. Those files will be overwritten by the ones found in the libax25-dev
package.

- Build and Install on Debian 10:

        # minimum required stuff
        sudo apt-get install devscripts build-essential lintian

        # clean out old debs (will prompt)
        rm -vi *.deb

        ## LIBAX25 build/install
        # H/T: comment on https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/416517/36152
        (cd libax25 && mk-build-deps --install --tool 'sudo apt-get --yes --no-install-recommends' --remove && debuild -us -uc)
        # install these now, otherwise we'll get the upstream libax25 v0.0.0 as part of tools/apps req's
        sudo apt-get install ./libax25_*.deb ./libax25-dev*.deb

        ## AX25TOOLS and APPS
        (cd ax25tools && mk-build-deps --install --tool 'sudo apt-get --yes --no-install-recommends' --remove && debuild -us -uc)
        (cd ax25apps && mk-build-deps --install --tool 'sudo apt-get --yes --no-install-recommends' --remove && debuild -us -uc)
        sudo apt-get install ./ax25tools_*.deb ./ax25apps_*.deb
