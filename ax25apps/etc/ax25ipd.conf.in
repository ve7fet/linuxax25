# ax25ipd configuration file
#
# See @datadir@/doc/ax25-apps/README.ax25ipd and HISTORY.ax25ipd 
# for further information.
#
# To start ax25ipd with a different config file:
#  ax25ipd -c /some/where/ax25ipd.conf
#
# Select axip transport. 
# ip or udp are your options
# ip has traditionally been used
# udp is used between FPAC nodes
# 
# If using UDP for transport, be sure to specify the socket THIS node is
# using.
#
# socket ip
socket udp 10093
#
# Set ax25ipd mode of operation. (digi or tnc)
#
mode tnc
#
# If you selected digi, you must define a callsign.  If you selected
# tnc mode, the callsign is currently optional, but this may change
# in the future! (2 calls if using dual port kiss)
#
#mycall vk5xxx-4
#mycall2 vk5xxx-5
#
# In digi mode, you may use an alias. (2 for dual port)
#
#myalias svwdns
#myalias2 svwdn2
#
# Send an ident every 540 seconds ...
#
#beacon after 540
#btext ax25ip -- tncmode rob/vk5xxx -- Experimental AXIP gateway

#
# Serial port, ethertap interface, or pipe connected to a kissattach instance
#
# Alternatively, if you have the kernel module bpqether:
# if you use tun/tap or ethertap instead of kissattach you may say, without
# leading slashes (!! - that's how ax25ipd consideres using the tty kiss
# driver or tun/tap or ethertap):
#   with tun/tap:
#     device foobar
#   with ethertap (obsolete):
#     device tap0
# make sure you set a mycall above, or say axparms foobar -setcall te1st
# note: the device will be up when you assign an ip address
# _after_ starting ax25rtd (which initializes the device), start ax25d
# with bpqether or pty, you do not need to care about the speed
# tun/tap: as descriped in /usr/src/linux/Documentatioa/networking/tuntap.txt,
# make a device # like this:
#   crw-r--r--    1 root     root      10, 200 Nov 26 13:32 tun
# with the command mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200
#
# With a serial port, you could assign physical ports like ttyS0 or ptys.
# ax25ipd  supports  BSD-style  pseudo-terminals as well as the Unix98 pty's.
# If the tty argument is "/dev/ptmx", then Unix98 behaviour
# will automaticaly take effekt. With Unix98 pty's, the slave tty name
# can not be predicted. That's why ax25ipd will print the corresponding
# slave pty name as a separate line on stdout.
# 
# Currently, the most common way to utilize ax25ipd is to attach it to a 
# kissattach instance through a Unix98 pty tunnel.
#
# You would want to do something like this in a shell startup script:
#  @prefix@/sbin/ax25ipd  > /tmp/unix98
#  echo $! > /var/run/ax25ipd.pid
#  export AXUDP=`tail -1 /tmp/unix98`
#  #
#  echo "Installing a KISS link on ethernet port"
#  @prefix@/sbin/kissattach  $AXUDP axudp 44.151.75.15 > /tmp/ax25-config.tmp
#   awk '/device/ { print $7 }' /tmp/ax25-config.tmp > /tmp/ax25-config-tmp
#  read Device < /tmp/ax25-config-tmp
#  # Check for Device
#  if [ -d /proc/sys/net/ax25/$Device ]
#  then echo "Port axudp attached to $Device"
#   cd /proc/sys/net/ax25/$Device/
#   # ifconfig $Device parameters
#   ifconfig $Device netmask 255.255.255.255
#   ifconfig $Device broadcast 0.0.0.0
#  else echo "** Error setting $Device parms **"
#  fi
#
# The code above will start ax25ipd, grab the slave tty name, start kissattach 
# on the other end of the tunnel (slave), and set some parameters for the interface.
#
#device ampr

#
# Set the device speed
#
# ***NOTE*** By default, ax25ipd will use 9600 for the speed if your system does not
# support speeds faster than this, and/or you try and tell it to use an unsupported speed.
#
# Versions of ax25ipd <=1.0.6 only support up to max speed of 38400
# Versions of ax25ipd >=1.1.0 support additional speeds of 57600 and 115200
#
# This speed only affects serial communications (ie directly with a TNC). It does not 
# have any effect when using IP/UDP.

# ax.25 route definition, define as many as you need.
# format is route (call/wildcard) (ip host at destination)
# ssid of 0 routes all ssid's
#
# route <destcall> <destaddr> <UDP port> [flags]
#
# Valid flags are:
#	  l  - update the address based on incoming packets
#	  p  - check DNS until it succeeds, and the never again
#         b  - allow broadcasts to be transmitted via this route
#         d  - this route is the default route
#
# route N0ONE-0 44.23.1.1 udp 10093 b
# send all traffic for N0ONE to 4.23.1.1 as well as send broadcasts
#
# route vk2sut-0 44.23.2.2 udp 10093 d
# send all traffic for vk2sut out this route, and any traffic that 
# doesn't match any other destination (default route)
#
# route KE6I-1 0.0.0.0 l
# the route to KE6I-1 will be updated based on IP addresses of incoming packets
#
# route KE6I-2 ke6i.ampr.org p
# check the DNS for ke6i.ampr.org on startup, if it succeeds, don't check it 
# again. If it fails, check until it succeeds, and then don't check again.
