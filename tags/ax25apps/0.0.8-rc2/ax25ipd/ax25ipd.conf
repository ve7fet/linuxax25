# Serial port, ethertap interface, or pipe connected to a kissattach in my case
#
# alternatively, if you have the kernel module bpqether:
# if you use tun/tap or ethertap instead of kissattach you may say, without
# leading slashes (!! - that's how ax25ipd consideres using the tty kiss
# driver or tun/tap or ethertap):
#   with tun/tap:
#     device foobar
#   with ethertap (obsolete):
#     device tap0
# make sure you set a mycall above, or say axparms foobar -setcall te1st
# note: the device will be up when you assign an ip address
# _after_ starting ax25rtd (which initializes the device), start ax25d
# with bpqether or pty, you do not need to care about the speed
# tun/tap: as descriped in /usr/src/linux/Documentatioa/networking/tuntap.txt,
# make a device # like this:
#   crw-r--r--    1 root     root      10, 200 Nov 26 13:32 tun
# with the command mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200
# As serial port, you could assign physical ports like ttyS0 or ptys.
# ax25ipd  supports  BSD-style  pseudo-terminals as well as the Unix98 pty's.
# If the tty argument is "/dev/ptmx", then Unix98 behaviour
# will automaticaly take effekt. With Unix98 pty's, the slave tty name
# could not be forseen. That's why ax25ipd will print the corresponding
# slave pty name as a separate line on stdout.
