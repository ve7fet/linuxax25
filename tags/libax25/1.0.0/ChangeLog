libax25 1.0.0 
	* This is a custom release, not associated with the official source. 
	* This library has been beta for so long, it is time to release version 1.0.0.
	* Added missing compile flag for ax25io (-lz) in the ax25io/Makefile.am.
	  Note that it HAS to be in the form libax25io_la_LIBADD for it to be
	  picked up properly (found this out trying to make the Debian package).
	* Removed etc files (moved them to ax25-tools where they belong
	* Removed associated man pages to ax25-tools
	* Made the libax25.spec file get processed by configure properly
	* Reverted a couple of Bernard's patches in axutils.c back to what was 
	  in CVS per discussions with Thomas Osterried
	* Updated configure scripts for automake 1.10.1 and autoconf 2.61
	* Fixed configure.ac to do a proper check for zlib.h (to build ax25io)
	  and abort the configure if zlib is not found
	* Cleaned up the Makefile.am
	* Moved source files out of the root folder and in to /lib, /man, and /etc
	* Added patch from Bernard Pidoux <f6bvp@free.fr> to axutils.c
